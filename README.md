## Key Projects

### A* Algorithm 
* Started with a priority queue to keep track of tentative distances from the start node to all other nodes
* Implemented functions to find the shortest path between two points, considering various obstacles and optimizing the path based on cost functions
* Used a heuristic function to estimate the cost of the cheapest path from node n to the goal
* For each neighbor node, tenative g-score is calculated from the start node to find total cost

**Libraries**: No library used

### Dijkstra Algorithm
* Started with a priority queue to maintain nodes sorted by their tentative distance from the start node
* Implemented a function that explores all reachable nodes from the start node, considering them in order of their distance from the start
* Function selects the node with the smallest tentative distance and updates the distances to its neighbors until all nodes have been processed or the priority queue is empty

**Libraries**: No library used

### Bellman-Ford Algorithm
* Implemented a code which initializes distances from the source node to all other nodes as infinity, except for the source node itself which is set to 0
* Implemented a function that updates the shortest path distances if a shorter path through a node is found
* Iterates through all edges multiple times, adjusting the shortest path estimates by considering each edge's weight
